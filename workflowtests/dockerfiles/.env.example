# Optional env file for workflowtests compose mode.
# Default compose commands run without this file.
# Tip: set `COMPOSE_FILE=workflowtests/dockerfiles/docker-compose.workflowtests.yml`
# in your shell to avoid passing `-f ...` repeatedly.

# Optional host port mapping for worker metrics.
# This is used by worker-* services when run with `--service-ports`.
OMES_WORKER_PROM_PORT=19090

# Optional socket override for cAdvisor.
# Set this on macOS Docker Desktop (recommended):
# DOCKER_SOCKET=/Users/<your-user>/.docker/run/docker.sock
#
# Linux default (usually no override needed):
# DOCKER_SOCKET=/var/run/docker.sock
